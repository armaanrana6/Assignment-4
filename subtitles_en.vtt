In this video, i'll tell about how to make a portfolio.   


00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:13.074
In this portfolio, I have put my name, about links, contact link and projects.


00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:21.074
And I have put some images of website I have made.

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:25.074
Along with email and a footer.

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:34.074
So, we go to Visual Studio Code and we go to index.html.

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:47.074
In this I have provided a link to the css and I have put a footer and given height.

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:03.074
So, we go to index.js and in this I have imported some bootstrap files. 


00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:25.074
And I have provided links to the images, the background

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:40.074
Here is the form I have put a label for name.


00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:05.074
In that navigation, I have put all the icon-bars.
